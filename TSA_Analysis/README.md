## Brief overview of staining method 
Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA) is a multiround, multiplexed method of staining FFPE tissue with high specificity for multiple overlapping markers. It uses enzyme-mediated catalysis of HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies to deposit a labeled tyramide or OPAL fluorophore at the site of primary antibody detection, which remains in place after primary and secondary antibodies are stripped away by a microwaving step. The order and concentration of primary and secondary antibodies, as well as pairing with each OPAL fluorophore must be carefully considered based on overall intensity of protein expression and detectability of epitopes.

1. Human tumor samples are fixed and prepared before being stained for six critical markers using a multiplexed Tyramide Signal Amplification method described in methods paper above
* EMT markers
  + Transcription Factors: Snail & ZEB1
  + Intermediate Filaments: K8, K14, VIM
  + Cell Adherens Junction: E-Cadherin
2.  Stained tissue slides are imaged and Regions of Interest (ROIs) are chosen to represent and encompass the totality of the tumor
3.  Imaging analysis conducted using Perkin Elmer software to segment cells as well as assign and train algorithm to detect cellular phenotypes based on co-expression and localization of markers
4.
